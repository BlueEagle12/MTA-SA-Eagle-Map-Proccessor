	// Running the map
		After you have everything setup start the 'eagleMapProccessor" as a resource, and it'll

		start the 'eagleLoader' resource then start your map, and it should load.

		If you're having issues read the output log "debug.txt" and will tell you any issues that occured
		during map proccessing.
